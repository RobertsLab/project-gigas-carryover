### Experimental Design Overview

- 12-well plate had oysters in wells A01-C01.
- Wells C02-C03 were negative controls.
- Well C04 was empty (i.e. no liquid of any kind).
- Time 0 (t0) measurements were taken _before_ the addition of oysters.
- For heat stress, resazurin assay media was distributed to wells/dishes and pre-heated to 35<sup>o</sup>C for 45mins prior to the t0 measurement.
