### Plate files used with CFX Maestro (Bio-Rad) software

The plate files are named in the following fashion:

- `cgig-<target>-cfx-plate-0[123].pltd`

`<target>` indicates the gene target for that plate.

There are three plates per target (`-01.pltd`, `-02.pltd`, `-03.pltd`).

For more specific information on primers used for each target, use the SRIDs below to find information, including primer sequences, in the Roberts Lab [`PrimerDatabase`](https://b.link/primer-database) (Google Sheet).

- `*ATP_synthase*`: SRIDs 1385/6.

- `*cGAS*`: SRIDs 1826/7.

- `*citrate_synthase*`: SRIDs 1383/4.

- `*DNMT1*`: SRIDs 1510/1.

- `*GAPDH*`: SRIDs 1172/3. Based on qPCR tests, this was utilized as the normalizing gene for qPCR analysis.

- `*HSP70*`: SRIDs 598/9.

- `*HSP90*`: SRIDs 1532/3.

- `*VIPERIN*`: SRIDs 1828/9.
