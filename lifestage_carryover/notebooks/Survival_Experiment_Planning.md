# Planning for Survivorship measurements 

Experimental design and project planning notes for lifestage carry over project survival analysis.  

## Question of interest and hypothesis

*Does stress hardening increase temperature tolerance in oysters and does this effect vary by lifestage?*   

- **Hypothesis 1**: Stress hardening will increase survival times at elevated temperatures. 
- **Hypothesis 2**: The magnitude of sress hardening effects will vary by lifestage (i.e., between adults, seed, and spat). 

## General method approach

Survivorship curves at elevated and control temperatures for each life stage

Kaplan-Meier survivorship curves (individual censoring over time)

## Proposed experimental design 

xxx

Water changes how often? 
Jars of water at temperature ready  
Filtered water?  
Size of container?  
Temperature treatment level?  
Logger deployment  
Record animal length, width, depth 
Record survival every 2-6 hours? 
Definition of survival 
Reciprocal design


## Replication 

*Reciprocal exposure?* 

Adults: n=15 animals per treatment per family; n=3 families

- n=45 animals treated; n=45 animals control 
- n=7-8 animals control-high
- n=7-8 animals treated-high
- n=7-8 animals control-control
- n=7-8 animals treated-control

*Is this enough?* 

Seed: n=18 animals per treatment

- n=18 animals treated; n=18 animals control
- n=9 animals control-high
- n=9 animals treated-high
- n=9 animals control-control
- n=9 animals treated-control

*Is this enough?* 

Spat: Hundreds per treatment available 

- n=50-100 animals control-high
- n=50-100 animals treated-high
- n=50-100 animals control-control
- n=50-100 animals treated-control
