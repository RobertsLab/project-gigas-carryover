# Planning for Feb 28 2024 sampling 

## Purpose

The purpose of this experiment is to collect samples of previously thermally conditioned oysters (*C. gigas*) of four life stages: spat, seed, juveniles, and adults. We will expose these lifestages to an acute stress test and collect samples to understand if stress hardening occurred as a result of pre conditioning. We will exposed half of each lifestage to ambient conditions and half to stress conditions, generating 4 treatment groups for each lifestage.  
 
**Conditioning Treatment - Stress Treatment**  

1. Ambient - Ambient (control oysters)
2. Ambient - Stress (testing stress effects on naive oysters without conditioning)
3. Conditioned - Ambient (testing effects of conditioning in absence of stress)
4. Conditioned - Stress (testing effects of conditioning on stress response)

*Note that for adults we also have triploids and diploids.*  

See previous posts about this project in Eric's [notebook](https://eric-ess.github.io/notebook/) and Ariana's [notebook](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/categoryview/#wsg-usda).  

## Hypotheses 

Our question of interest is, *"Does preconditioning improve stress tolerance in oysters and is there differential capacity for stress hardening by life stage?"*.  
 
Our hypotheses are:  

1. Thermal conditioning improves stress tolerance.
2. Exposure to thermal preconditioning will improve stress tolerance through higher expression of stress response genes in oysters. 
3. Early life stages (e.g., seed and spat) will exhibit a stronger response of conditioning than older life stages, due to developmental plasticity (i.e., spat > seed > juvenile > adult). 
4. There are molecular markers of stress hardening that can be identified through qPCR of stress responsive genes. 
 
## Experimental Design

To test these hypotheses, we will conduct an acute stress exposure. Oysters were previously conditioned in fall 2023 (Oct-Nov) to either an ambient/control treatment (17°C, no mechanical stress) or a conditioning treatment (daily ramp to 25°C for 6 h daily with once weekly mechanical stress of juveniles and adults).

Here is the general approach we can use for the day:  

1. Prepare and organize all equipment (below)
2. Go over protocols as a group to standardize approach (below)
3. Assess size and mortality of all oysters and take images of spat for future image analyses 
4. Add new and clear labels to all containers/bags so that they can be moved between tanks. Mark with conditioning treatment, lifestage, and replicate ID. 
5. Assess sample size and distribution of oysters between control and high acute stress treatments
6. Re-arrange oysters between a control and high tank in the combinations listed above 
7. Start the stress exposure by heating the treatment tank (below) *- Add mechanical stress if using*  
8. At the end of the stress exposure, conduct sampling (below) 
9. Download loggers 
10. Clean equipment and reset any remaining oysters 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: Per [this post](https://eric-ess.github.io/experiment-setup/). Because juveniles and adults were also mechanically stressed, but seed and spat were not,  we cannot really compare the conditioning treatments between life stages correct? Does mechanical stress need to be in the acute stress for those lifestages? Or should we keep the stress consistent between all life stages?** 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: How long was the conditioning carried out for in Oct/Nov?**  

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: How long should the acute stress be? Previously (in Nov sampling), the stress was 30 min long. Is this enough to see a difference? Should the exposure be longer? Should it be more like 2-3 hours at a high temperature? Per [this post](https://eric-ess.github.io/SecondStressPrep/).** 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: We should consider having all of them in closed containers for this experiment so that they are truly independent, rather than having them in flow through containers. Thoughts?** 

## Treatment conditions

We will manipulate temperature by heating water in one of the large white tanks and leaving the other at ambient temperature. 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: Previously this was done by immersing animals in pre-heated buckets. Do we want to use this approach again? Could we instead heat the white tanks? If so, do we have heaters out at the hatchery already? Ariana can go out on Monday to test.**  

Oysters will be ramped at a rate of 2°C per hour (as previously used during conditioning period) until reaching the target temperature. 32°C acute stress without ramping was used in the November sampling. 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: Should we use 32°C here again as well? Is this a relevant temperature? Has the target stress changed with seasonality?**  

## Sampling protocols

Here are some simplified overviews of protocols that we will be using for this sampling. 

### General protocols for all sampling types 

- All sampling should be done from oysters taken directly from the treatment (should have minimal if any time out of treatment before sampling) and in random order (e.g., dont sample all ambient and then all high - that would cause the high treatment to be exposed longer due to the time of sampling). 
- All sampling must be done sterile, **especially** RNA/DNA sampling. Surfaces, gloves, tools, razors, knives, etc. MUST be sterilized between all samples using 70% ethanol, 10% bleach, and water. 
- Every sample MUST be recorded on a data sheet (below). All tubes must be labeled with a clear ID. The following metadata must be recorded: replicate, lifestage, tank/tube, treatment, number animals/size of tissue, method of sampling, time sampled, initials of sampler, volume of solvent/buffer, location in freezer/lab, and any notes. 
- All sampling should have only one animal per tube. If we need to pool animals downstream for analyses we can do that later, but we cannot separate individuals later on if we pool when sampling. 
- Record all proceedures in a notebook. 
- All tubes, all tanks, and all replicates MUST have unique ID's that can be tracked. 

#### 1. Growth and mortality assessments

- Go through each replicate tank/bag and record max. length for all live animals. Record the number of dead animals if mortality occured. 
- Sum the number of animals in each tank/bag. We will use this to distribute across treatments. 

**ARIANA WILL TRY TO DO THIS MONDAY THE 26th SO WE HAVE THE ANSWER AHEAD OF TIME.** 

#### 2. Collecting samples for RNA and DNA 

- Remove animal from treatment
- Immediately sample tissue with sterile surface and instruments
- Place one sample into labeled RNA tube with storage buffer 
- Place one sample into labeled DNA tube with storage buffer 
- Sterilize before the next sample 

**REPLICATION**: Eric sampled n=7-8 adults during first stressor. We should aim for n=8-10 minimum per group for RNA/DNA. This would result in the following sample sizes: 

1. Ambient - Ambient: 8-10 per lifestage
2. Ambient - Stress: 8-10 per lifestage
3. Conditioned - Ambient: 8-10 per lifestage
4. Conditioned - Stress: 8-10 per lifestage 

This would be a total of 10 replicates x 4 lifestages x 4 groups = 160 total animals sampled. If we then sample two tissue types from each animal, that would be 320 total tubes. However, this is likely only possible for adults and maybe juveniles. If we sample two tissue types from only adults and juveniles, our total sampling number would be 240 tubes. 

**QUESTION TO DISCUSS: Can we sample RNA/DNA in the same replicate or do we need to take a separate tube for RNA and one for DNA? I think Eric did separate sampling.** 

#### 3. Respiration immersion fluid testing 

We will want to try this on live animals before destructive sampling. 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: Do we want to run this as a test on a small subset or do a full sampling? How confident are we in this method?** 

**REPLICATION**: We could try n=5 per group (treatment x lifestage) for this sampling. Total animals would be 5 replicates x 4 lifestages x 4 groups = 80 animals. Total 80 tubes. 

#### 4. Collecting samples for test lab assays 

- Collect tissue samples from animals for lab assays including enzyme assays, antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial function, etc. 
- Collect tissue, place in labeled tube, and snap freeze. 

**REPLICATION**: We could try n=5-10 per group (treatment x lifestage) for this sampling. Total animals would be 10 replicates x 4 lifestages x 4 groups = 160 animals. Total 160 tubes.  

### Total animals needed 

- RNA/DNA = 40 animals per lifestage (20 conditioned and 20 not conditioned) 
- Respiration = 20 animals per lifestage (10 conditioned and 10 not conditioned) *may increase depending on what we want to do) 
- Physiology/assay testing = 40 animals per lifestage (20 conditioned and 20 not conditioned) 

Total animals = 100 per lifestage (50 conditioned and 50 not conditioned)  

Note that we can take the physiology sample from the same animal as the DNA/RNA sample if they are big enough (likely only juveniles and adults). 

--> **QUESTION TO DISCUSS: Do we have enough? Pending AH assessment on Monday the 26th. Decide on which animals are big enough to take physiology and molecular from the same animal and which need to be separate animals.**  

## Scheduling 

We will have several people helping for this sampling: Steven, Eric, Ariana, Kathleen, and Grace. 

We will expect to start set up and preparations around 9am with a goal to start the stress treatments by 11am-1pm. Sampling could then occur around 1-3pm with the day finished by 5pm or earlier. This timeline could change depending on answers to our questions above.
