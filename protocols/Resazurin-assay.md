# Resazurin-assay

1. **Plate oysters (1/well; if testing in 2-3 mm spat one can use a 96 well plate and 300 ul of assay media. If using larger oysters you can use a 48 well plate and 1 mL of assay media.)**  
   When you plate them you can do so in water with antibiotics and fungizone. Weigh oysters as you plate them so you can correct for weight. Alternatively, plate them, take a picture and measure area using image J.
   - **Water: (Volume/100 mL)**
     1. Sterile water with appropriate Salinity – 98 mL (Sterile Filter or Autoclave)
     2. 100X Penn/Strep – 1 mL
     3. 100X Fungizone – 1 mL

2. **Allow oysters to be in Antibiotic/Fungizone Water for at least 1 h**

3. **Make Resazurin Stock Solution (This can be frozen; 50 mg/ml)**
   - 0.5 g of resazurin sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)
   - 10 mL of distilled water
   - 10 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1% DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO)

4. **Make Assay Media**
   - Sterile water with appropriate Salinity – 96.9 mL (Sterile Filter or Autoclave)
   - Resazurin Stock Solution – 1 mL (This can be replaced with AlamarBlue, which is used at 1.6%)
   - 100X Penn/Strep – 1 mL
   - 100X Fungizone – 1 mL
   - DMSO – 100 uL

5. **Set Gain on Plate Reader**
   - Plate 300 ul into blank well of 96 well plate and read (Excitation 530; Emission 590)
   - Adjust gain manually until signal is around 500. This is essential to ensure sensitivity.

6. **Add Assay Media to each well (300 ul in 96-well plate or 1 mL in 48 well plate).**

7. **Read plate immediately upon adding Assay media**

8. **Read plate at intervals thereafter (if you are at 30 ppt this should occur at 1, 3, and 6 h; if you are at 4 ppt you may want 6, 12, and 24h).**  
   This allows you to show that signal increased linearly with time. If you find that you have a specific timepoint that you like for future studies you can just use that timepoint.

9. **Calculate the change in fluorescence.**

10. **Calculate the change in fluorescence/area or mass.**

11. **Sort oysters according to a high or low change in fluorescence/area or mass (low change will grow more quickly).**
