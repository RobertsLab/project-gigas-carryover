## Sample Collection
1. **Make SEI buffer:**
   - 42.79 g Sucrose
   - 1.86 g EDTA
   - 1.7 g Imidazole
   - Dissolve all into approximately 400 ml diH2O
   - Adjust pH to 7.3, adjust volume to 500 ml with diH2O, store at 4° C
2. Place metal block and SEI buffer on ice.
3. Using transfer pipette, fill 0.5 ml tube about halfway full of SEI buffer.
4. Cut a small section of gill, including filaments and arch, and place tissue into SEI buffer, about a 1:20 ratio of tissue to buffer is ideal. The tissue tends to become gluey if there is too much in the tube.
5. Using a transfer pipette, top off tube with SEI buffer. Make sure that the tissue is completely submerged in buffer.
6. **Storage Options:**
   a. Leave samples in the metal block on ice until they are transported to a freezer at the end of the day. If the available freezer is not a -80° C, transfer to a -80° C as soon as possible.
   b. Freeze samples periodically during sampling with dry ice or a -20° C freezer. Transfer to -80° C as soon as possible.
   c. Freeze at -80° C periodically during sampling.  
   (The general theme here is keep samples as cold as possible given available resources and transfer samples to -80° C as soon as possible)
